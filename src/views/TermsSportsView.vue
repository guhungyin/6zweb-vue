        divided into 2 equal bets and placed on the outcomes -1.5 and -2.0. For the bet to be fully
        paid out at the listed odds, Team A must win the match with a bigger margin than both of
        their listed handicaps (ie. 3 goals or more margin). In the eventuality that Team A wins
        with only a 2 goal margin, the bet will be considered as partially won with a full payout on
        the -1.5 part of the bet and a refund on the -2.0 side since the outcome on that part of the
        bet would be considered a “tie”. Should the match produce any other outcome, including a
        Team A victory with only 1 goal margin, the whole stake would be lost. Away teams are given
        a +1.75 goal advantage in the match. This means that the stake is divided into 2 equal bets
        and placed on the outcomes +1.5 and +2.0.
